## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-13

Initial public release.

### Added
- Deterministic CLI gate over six Tier-1 scanners: Bandit, Semgrep, pip-audit,
  npm audit, Gitleaks, and a built-in regex rule pack.
- SARIF 2.1.0 emit + ingest. External SARIF (CodeQL, Snyk, Trivy, etc.) merges
  with locally-run findings via fingerprint dedupe.
- Standards taxonomy: every finding maps to a CWE id (dedupe key), OWASP Top
  10 bucket, OWASP ASVS section, and NIST SSDF practice. Top-25 CWEs get a
  1.25× scoring boost.
- Nine canonical audit categories: `secrets`, `dependencies`,
  `code_vulnerabilities`, `auth_authz`, `crypto`, `supply_chain`,
  `config_iac`, `logging_observability`, `policy_docs`.
- Scoring model with worst-category-drives-grade semantics (mirrors
  `maintainability-agent`'s pattern). Letter grade A+ → F.
- Hard gates: `fail_on_severity`, `fail_on_category`, `fail_on_new`,
  `min_score`, `max_unsuppressed`. Compose with OR semantics.
- Suppressions (`.scignore.yaml`) with mandatory `reason` + `expires`
  (max 365 days). Past-expiry suppressions become CRITICAL findings on
  their own.
- Baseline (`secure-code-baseline.json`) for incremental adoption.
  Per-fingerprint `bumped_by` records the operator's git `user.email`.
- Bounded remediation prompt generator (`secure-code-remediation-prompt.md`)
  — the differentiator. Hard constraints encoded against the documented
  AI-fix failure modes (crypto roulette, auth-flow rewrite, validation
  softening, test deletion, lint disable, scope creep).
- Per-agent standards file emit via `--init-agent-standards`. Targets:
  `codex`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `generic`.
- Invokable skill bundle at `skills/secure-code-agent/` (Anthropic-format
  SKILL.md + Codex + Copilot adapters) — portable across Claude Code,
  Codex, and Copilot Chat.
- Comprehensive docs: design, standards anchors, scoring math, scanner
  caveats, remediation rationale, threat model.

### Known limitations
- No CodeQL invocation — CodeQL runs in GitHub-hosted analysis; we ingest
  its SARIF artifact via `--sarif-import`.
- Tier-2 scanners (Trivy, Checkov, Hadolint, OSV-Scanner, OpenSSF Scorecard)
  have protocol stubs but no full implementation in v0.1 — tracked for v0.2.
- No language coverage beyond what Tier-1 scanners support (Python, JS/TS).
  Go / Java / Rust / Ruby scanners (gosec, SpotBugs, Brakeman) tracked for v0.3.
